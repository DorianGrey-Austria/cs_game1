- Floating holographic elements and digital particles in the air
- A dark starry sky with subtle aurora effects
- Multiple layers for parallax scrolling effect (foreground, midground, background)
- Smooth gradients from deep purple/navy at the top to darker tones at bottom
- Subtle grid patterns and geometric shapes scattered throughout
- Atmospheric haze/fog for depth
